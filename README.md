# Pest IDE Tools

_IDE support for [Pest](https://pest.rs), via the LSP._

This repository contains an implementation of the _Language Server Protocol_ in Rust, for
the Pest parser generator.

## Features

- Error reporting.
- Warnings for unused rules.
- Syntax highlighting definitions available.
- Rename rules.
- Go to rule declaration, definition, or references.
- Hover information for built-in rules and documented rules.
- Autocompletion of defined rule names.
- Formatting.
- Update checking.

Please see the
[issues page](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest-ide-support/issues) to suggest
features or view previous suggestions.

## Usage

### Supported IDEs

- [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pest.pest-ide-tools)
  - VSCode has a pre-built extension that can compile, update, and start up the language server. It also includes syntax highlighting definitions.

Due to the usage of the LSP by this project, adding support for new IDEs should
be far more achievable than a custom implementation for each editor. Please see the [tracking issue](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest-ide-tools/issues/10) to request support for another IDE or view the current status of IDE support.

### Config

The method of updating your config is editor specific.

The available options are:

```jsonc
{
  // Set a custom path to a Pest LS binary.
  "pestIdeTools.serverPath": "/path/to/binary",
  // Check for updates to the Pest LS binary via crates.io
  "pestIdeTools.checkForUpdates": true,
  // Ignore specific rule names for the unused rules diagnostics (useful for specifying root rules)
  "pestIdeTools.alwaysUsedRuleNames": [
    "rule_one",
    "rule_two"
  ]
}
```

## Development

This repository uses a [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev); install
the `task` command for a better experience developing in this repository.

The task `fmt-and-lint` can be used to check the formatting and lint your code to ensure it
fits with the rest of the repository.

In VSCode, press `F5` to build and debug the VSCode extension.

### Architecture

The server itself is implemented in Rust using `tower-lsp`. It communicates with
editors via JSON-RPC through standard input/output, according to the language
server protocol.
