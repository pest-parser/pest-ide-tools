# Pest IDE Tools

_IDE support for [Pest](https://pest.rs), via the LSP._

This repository contains an implementation of the _Language Server Protocol_ for the [Pest](https://pest.rs) parser generator.

## Features

- [x] Error reporting.
- [x] Syntax highlighting.
- [x] Rename support.
- [x] Go to declaration/definition.
- [x] Find references.
- [x] Highlighting a rule highlights it's references.
- [x] Hover information for built-in rules.
- [x] Intellisense/completion of rule names.
- [x] Formatting.
- [ ] Debugging window (as on the Pest website).

## Supported IDEs

- Visual Studio Code

Due to the usage of the LSP by this project, adding support for new IDEs should
be far more achievable than a custom implementation for each editor.

### Planned Support

- Neovim.
- Fleet, once it releases.

## Development

This repository uses a [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev); I recommend installing the `task` command for a better experience developing in this repository.

The task `fmt-and-lint` can be used to format and lint your code to ensure it fits with the rest of the repository.

### Architecture

The server itself is implemented in Rust. It contains several methods which are called by each editor extension upon important events. The server is packaged into a WASM module.

Each extension is implemented in the language that makes the most sense for its respective editor.
